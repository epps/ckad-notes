# Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) - Study Notes

## Overview

I've decided to challenge myself to pass the [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) exam. To keep myself accountable and motivated, I'm going to document my study notes here.

## Resources

- PluralSight: [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad-2023) - I have ~2 months left on my PluralSight subscription, so I'm going to complete this learning path before my subscription expires

## Environment Setup

- A couple of months back, I build a 4-node Raspberry Pi cluster based closely on [_How to build a Raspberry Pi cluster_](https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/cluster-raspberry-pi-tutorial/); however, I initially had issues installing [K3s](https://k3s.io/) and later had issues with volumes when testing out some initial Kubernetes deployments. These issues made it painfully clear that I needed to level up my understanding/mental model of K8s. While I'm sure some issues are still lurking in this setup, the tiny-but-mighty cluster will serve as my primary learning environment for the CKAD exam.
